            BASIC TERMS IN PYTHON

1 VARIABLES-->python variable are simple container for storing data values

2 IDENTIFIERS-->python identifiers are user defined name given to a variable ,function,class,module etc
     
       Rules for naming a identifiers
       
       1->an identifier cannot be a keyword
       2->Identifiers are case-sensitive.
       3->It can have a sequence of letters and digits. However, it must begin with a letter or _. The first letter of an identifier 
          cannot be a digit
       4->Whitespaces are not allowed.
       5->We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, and so on.

NOTE-->Always give the identifiers a name that makes sense. 

3 KEYWORDS-->python keywords are reserved ,predefined word that have special meaning to the compiler
          -->we cannot use a keyword as variable,identifier or function name
          -->for example
          -->language = 'Python'
             Here, language is a variable (an identifier) which holds the value 'Python'.

4 COMMENTS-->Comments in Python are the lines in the code that are ignored by the interpreter during the execution of the program.
             Comments enhance the readability of the code and help the programmers to understand the code very carefully.
             
       -->single line comment-
                                  start with an #symbol
                                  for example #this is python code  
                                  
       -->multiline comments- 
                                  #symbol can be used in multiple line
                                  for example #this is a multiline python comment
                                              #here we can use # multiple times
           -                      we can also use triplet as comments 
                                   for example """this is a comment"""

5 INDENTATION-->Python indentation refers to adding white space before a statement to a particular block of code. In another word,
                 all the statements with the same space to the right, belong to the same code block.
  

6  IDE vs IDLE
                IDE-->
                       Ide stand for integrated development Environment . IDE is a software environment which usually consist of a 
                        software
                        development package containing code editor,build automation.tools & debugger 

                IDLE-->DLE is a acronym for Integrated Development and Learning Environment. This includes the basic packages and 
                       concepts 
                              of an IDE in addition for learning and educational purposes .
                      -->  IDLE is the integrated development environment (IDE) provided with Python
